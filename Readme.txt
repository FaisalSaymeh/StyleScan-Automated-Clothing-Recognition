Our project consists of three Jupyter Notebooks: 1) Resizing, 2) Resizing-Normalization, and 3) Resizing-Augmentation-Normalization. 
The purpose of creating these notebooks is to enhance modularity, organization, collaboration, and reproducibility within the project, 
while also facilitating experimentation and code reuse.

To run this code successfully, follow these steps:

1. Install Required Libraries:

pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install opencv-python
pip install scikit-learn
pip install tensorflow
pip install imgaug

2. Prepare the Data:

Ensure you have the required CSV files (images-1.csv, images-2.csv, and images-3.csv) 
and images in a folder named images.

3. Run the Entire Code Block:
Execute the entire script in your Python environment like Jupyter Notebook or VSCode. Ensure your working directory contains the CSV files and the images folder.


******* Tips *******


- You can run the entire code blocks of "Resizing" Jupyter Notebook but there are some code block
  will take time to run the block are:

===========================================================================================================================================


-Be advised the entire code blocks in the "Resizing-Normalization" and "Resizing-Augmentation-Normalization" Jupyter Notebooks. 
 However, please be aware that some errors might be encountered depending on the device specifications, particularly in RAM.


- To avoid the following errors:
  
  1. Keras crashes
  
  2. MemoryError (ex: MemoryError: Unable to allocate 32.67 GiB for an array with shape (71235, 100, 100, 3) and  data type float32)
  
  3. Window pop out with message ("Application Error Click Ok to Terminate the Program)

  4. Session Crash Open New Session



- Waiting a few minutes on some specific blocks which I am going to mention them below for each Notebook.

***** Note *****

The previous batch numbers and the runtime depend on the device which been used for this project which could be vary from device to 
another especially the batch size could be modified depend on the RAM.
